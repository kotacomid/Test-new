## Chapter 1: Introduction to E-commerce and Dropshipping

### What is Dropshipping?
Dropshipping is an e-commerce business model where you sell products without holding inventory. When a customer places an order, you purchase the item from a third-party supplier who ships it directly to the customer. You act as the middleman, focusing on marketing and customer acquisition while suppliers handle fulfillment.

### Why Dropshipping Works
- **Low startup costs**: No need to purchase inventory upfront
- **Location independence**: Operate from anywhere with internet
- **Scalable business model**: No physical storage limitations
- **Wide product selection**: Access thousands of products instantly
- **Reduced risk**: Test products without large investments
- **Automated fulfillment**: Suppliers handle shipping and logistics

### Current Market Statistics
- Global dropshipping market valued at $197 billion in 2023
- Expected to grow at 23.6% CAGR through 2030
- 27% of online retailers use dropshipping as primary fulfillment method
- Average dropshipping profit margins range from 10-30%
- E-commerce accounts for 15% of total retail sales globally

### How Dropshipping Works

**The Process Flow:**
1. **Customer places order** on your online store
2. **You forward order details** to supplier
3. **Supplier ships product** directly to customer
4. **You keep the profit** (difference between retail and wholesale price)
5. **Customer receives product** with your branding

**Revenue Model:**
- Customer pays you: $50
- You pay supplier: $25
- Your profit: $25 (50% margin)
- Minus expenses (ads, platform fees, etc.)
